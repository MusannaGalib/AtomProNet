General:

  SYSTEM = Alumina_orthorombic_cell_under_strain
  ISTART=0       ! =1, if a WAVECAR file exists Continuation job: "restart with constant energy cut-off". Orbitals are read from the WAVECAR 
  ICHARG=2       ! ICHARG=1 , Read the charge density from CHGCAR file,   ICHARG 	= 2 	if ISTART=0 
  ENCUT = 400    !Default:  largest ENMAX on the POTCAR file 	    
  ALGO = Normal  ! IALGO=38 
  PREC= Normal
  ISPIN=1        ! non spin polarized calculation
  LWAVE  = T             (Write WAVECAR)
  LCHARG = T             (Write CHGCAR) 
  NPAR = 1

Electronic Relaxation:
  EDIFF = 1E-6   ! recommeded value for high precision

    
Ionic Relaxation:
  NSW = 0        !single point self consistant calculation with the relaxed structure, no ionic update is required 
  NELM = 100     !the maximum number of electronic SC (selfconsistency) steps which may be performed
  POTIM = 0.5    !scaling constant for the step widths
  IBRION = -1     !no update, The ions are not moved
  ISMEAR = 1     !for metal ISMEAR > 0 , Fermi smearing
  SIGMA = 0.026  !0.026 ev = 300K
  EDIFFG= -0.001 !Stopping criteria for ionic relaxation loop
  ISIF = 2       !Default: degree of freedom for positions only
  LREAL= Auto    !for larger cells it might be more efficient to use real-space projection operators
