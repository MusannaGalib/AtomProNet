# This is the 'requirements.txt' file for the Python project.
# It lists all the external Python packages (dependencies) the project needs.

# The purpose of this file is to ensure that anyone who sets up the project
# has all the necessary dependencies installed. This aids in maintaining
# consistency across different development environments.

# To install these dependencies, one can run the command:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# This command uses pip, the Python package manager, to install all listed packages.

# Listed Dependencies:
# ---------------------

# numpy: Required for numerical operations, large arrays, and matrices handling.
numpy

# ase: Used for atomistic simulations, essential for computational chemistry and materials science.
ase

# For materials project API
mp-api
pymatgen


# Note on 'os' Module:
# ---------------------
# The 'os' module is a built-in module in Python and does not need to be installed separately.
# It is available by default in all Python environments. Therefore, it's generally unnecessary
# to include it in the 'requirements.txt' file. However, if needed, it can be included here.
#os

# Note on Adding More Packages:
# -----------------------------
# If you add more package names to this file, there is no need to modify any other
# files for installation purposes. However, you may need to import and use these
# new packages in your Python scripts (e.g., in 'converter.py' or other modules) as needed.

# When a new package is added, simply listing it here (optionally with a version number)
# is sufficient for pip to handle its installation.
